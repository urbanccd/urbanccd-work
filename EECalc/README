This README documents the process of running the EPlus computations via Swift. The ~swift script for the computations is sweep1.swift. The prerequisites and preparation of run is described in the following points:

-- Access to OSDC
-- Swift installed: On OSDC Swift installation is available are /glusterfs/users/swiftlang/kmaheshwari/swift-0.94.1
   Add the bin dir of above installation to your PATH: export PATH=/glusterfs/users/swiftlang/kmaheshwari/swift-0.94.1/bin:$PATH

-- Create compute instances from a snapshot/image which has the current EPlus directory and the following libraries installed:
 glibc-static, glibc.i686, libgcc_s.so.1, libstdc++.so.6

-- To install the above libraries on an instance use yum: yum -y install glibc-static glibc.i686 libgcc_s.so.1 libstdc++.so.6

-- The compute nodes must also have the nodejs and nodejs module xml2json installed. The nodejs package can be installed by copying and untarring the node-v0.10.20-linux-x64.tar.gz package from /glusterfs/users/swiftlang/kmaheshwari on OSDC

-- The xml2json package is already installed in the EPlus/examples directory. On compute instances, set the NODE_PATH environment variable to make the module available:
 export NODE_PATH=$HOME/EPlus/example/node_modules

-- Add the ip addresses of currently running instances to a file called hosts.txt. for example, if the ips are 172.16.1.9 and 172.16.1.16. The hosts.txt will look like:
172.16.1.9 172.16.1.16

 To run the application on OSDC instances from OSDC login node follow the steps below:

step0. Change to the EPlus/examples directory:
 cd ~/EPlus/examples

step1. Run the setup script as follows: 
 ./setup
 This script will start the coaster service on login node and worker agents on compute nodes

step2. Run the Swift script as follows:
swift -sites.file sites.xml -tc.file tc.data -config cf sweep1.swift

step3. Once complete, clean the log files and stop the coaster service as follows:
  ./cleanup
