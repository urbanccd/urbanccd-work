To Run:

  Edit setenv.sh and check to ensure that the specified tool
  directories (for EnergyPlus and Node) exist and are accessible.


For Beagle:

  ./run.beagle.sh -sweep=t02.96T.12M.sweep -outdir=run09


For Open Science Data Cloud (OSDC):

  # start instances of Image "EPlus"

  # create hosts.txt file: list of space-separated host names or IP addresses
  # (can use listhosts.shh to get this list, from OSDC Sullivan login node.

  ./setup.sh  # to start Swift worker service

  ./run.osdc.sh -sweep=t02.96T.12M.sweep -outdir=run09

  ./cleanup   # to stop Swift worker service


Options for run scripts are:

  -outdir=run01
  -epconfig=SWEEP_RECT.imf
  -epweather=CHICAGO.epw
  -sweep=t1.sweep


Other run scripts are:

  ./run.beagle.debug.sh
  ./run.osdc.debug.sh


Sweep parameter files look like:

pnum pname        pvals
1    ORIENT       0,30,60
2    NumberFloors 5,10,15,20
3    W            10,20,30,40
4    L            10,20,30,40
5    WINTOP       1.8,2.5,3.5
6    HVACSystem   SYSTEM7,OptimizedVAV,DOASFCU,DOASECMFCU
7    ENDMONTH     2
8    ENDDAY       28

You can put *any* variables from the .imf file into the param-set
file.

The number of variables in this file is fixed, and must match the
number of loops and array entries in the sweep.swift script.

NOTE WELL: currently, 8

The current version of sweep.swift is limited to 8 variables but you
can easily add more to the .swift script. No .imf variable names are
hard-coded (or even appear) in the .swift script any more. 
If we set it to 12 or 15 that would be more than enough for most
imaginable studies. 

Unused variables must be coded as, e.g., "9 X X" where X can be any
string thats not a variable in the .imf file. (I think "X" is ok).
